#  Memorize

This App is the result of me following lectures 1 – 6 of »[Stanford CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS (Spring quarter 2020)](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu)«.

## Warning

This repository is not just a copy of the instructors code. I've added many of my own ideas and did some 
automated testing. I'm quite new to `XCTest` and iOS development in general. If you spot something that 
should be improved please let me know in the issue tracker.
